Matrix Abstract Data Type
(last updated in 2008)

 *	This is a data type meant to be used in 
 *	Linear Algebra calculations.
 *		The Matrix ADT can assume any size ( ROWSxCOLS )
 *		Matrices can be 
 *			1. Added
 *			2. Multiplied
 *			3. Transposed 
 *			4. Inverted		// NOT YET DEFINED
 *
 *	Matrices can be used to solve linear systems or to 
 *	perform linear transformations such as rotations and
 *	projections.

Future Plans:
 * Implement:
 	Inversion
	Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors
 * Generalize to Template for use with any type that supports + and * operators
 * Integrate with Boost Graph Library's adjacency_matrix type
